                        Our platform is simple and easy to use. Register with your email and verify your account. Once your account is verified, you’ll be asked of 
                        questions as who are you looking for (cofounders or investor), industry, skills 
                        and other information that may help you browse potential cofounders based on matching your profiles. 
                        <br /><br />
                        As a new user you will be allowed to communicate with other users for free. Browse unlimited profiles and discuss the possibility of partnerships up to five (5) accounts. If you exceed the maximum, a Startup Hero Upgrade will be recommended (optional).
