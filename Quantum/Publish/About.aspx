            <i>“I like to help startup co-founders who are from emerging markets and who have limited sources, limited access to funding and have less opportunity. If they have big ideas and are ambitious, they should be supported to make their dreams come true. This the reason behind Co-founders’ Network platform because I’m also one of them. I have the potential and skills but often discriminated because of where I come from. It dragged my opportunities until I’m in my 30’s. With our platform, together we can break the barrier and be successful.” – Kathleen</i>
